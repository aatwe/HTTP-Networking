a) What is HTTPS

encryption
Only sender and receiver can process the info

a.1) Any intermediaries? Yes : ISP , Router owner

	for ex. if http -> on public Wifi --> router owner can see info

	Soln: https


a.2) 

Given: Bug
if we send erquest --> it will fail (error: failed to fetch)		//Server rejecting plain http

Objective: send request over HTTPS


b) How to send request over HTTPS?


Ex

Client ----> Wifi ----> Router ---> ISP ----> Cloud Provider of server ----> Server

	a.2.1) How to encrypt and decrypt?

		Blue: public key		//use it to encrypt data	//can only use to enncrypt
			//Given to the client


		Red: private key		//use it to decrypt data
			//Stays on the server


	a.2.2) But still how to send server response safely? 3rd key

		Yellow: Encryption key
			//both receive it 	// can use to encrypt/ decrypt at both end



How key generation happens?

a.3)
	0) Client tries to send HTTPS request //cant yet
//Generate public and pvt key
	1) Server generates public & private key		//unless this is done https is not enabled	
	2) Client contacts server
	3) Server sends its public key generated to client

//Client gets public key
	4) Client decrypts public key
	5) Client has the public key

//Secret token generated at client
	6) for reverse from server, Client generates secret token
	7) Client sends secret token to server (encrypted the secret token using public key it got)

//Symmetric key generated at both end
	8) Server Decrypts secret token(using private key it had), Server generates symmetric key, Client generates symmetric key //Symmetric key is negotiated
//HTTPS lifecyle
	9) Client sends ---> HTTPs request	
	10) Server decrypts the HTTPS request successfully
	11) Server sends encrypted response
	12( Client decrypts the response
