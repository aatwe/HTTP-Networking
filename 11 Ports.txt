Why Port?
What if multiple things hosted on server? How to redirect correct request to correct place? PORTS
	


Host a website + Host a database


Port = hubs managed by OS
	segments data stream




Server

	Web server  ----- Port 80


	Database    ------ Port 5432



What problem solved? can run different insances on same server
			   can run multiple websites on same server

	2 website on same port? NO. Why? OS wont know



How many ports on OS allowed? 65,000 different

What type of ports we can use?  if dont type port in url, default port used
		//default port = protocol specific

Q1) what is localhost:8080		//localhost = domain of my own computer  , 8080 = port



a) brew install caddy		//else use caddyserver.com

b) Create index.html, name.txt in a directory Test
Both below files in same directory Test
index.html
<> index.html >
1 <html>
2
3 <body>
4 <h1>HOME PAGE</h1>
5 </body>
6
7 </html>
8


name.txt
Hi My name is lane


	a.1) cd to that directory Test

c) caddy file-server			//Run, default port chosen = 80, domain used= localhost

>Output:
index.html :
HOME PAGE


Q1) Why not Hi My name is lane?

file server (traditional) ---> routes "path" of directory  (path in url) ---> index.html  //default
localhost/index.html			//not neccessary

	//Backend servers: like Go and Django ---> different paths , access which file	 //Its all custom logic

Q2) How to get name.txt if want to?
localhost/name.txt

What given? user data in Fantasy Quest server
reaching users endpoint
'https://api.boot.dev/v1/courses_rest_api/learn—http/locations'
instead use 
Objective: get location data



Output: undefined		//not getting location data back
https://api.boot.dev/v1/courses_rest_api/learn—http/users' --> https://api.boot.dev/v1/courses_rest_api/learn—http/locations'

//what was the problem? users end point there was no data, we changed url
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

const url = 'https://api.boot.dev/v1/courses_rest_api/learn—http/locations'


// don't touch below this line
const apiKey = generateKey()
const response = await fetch(url, {
method: 'GET',
mode: 'cors',
headers: {
	'X-API—Key': apiKey,
	'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
})


const responseData = await response.json()		//wait to get response

logLocations(responseData)				//logLocations()	//loops and prints out location.name and location.recommendedLevel
function generateKey() {
	const characters = 'ABCDEF0123456789'
	let result = "
for (let i = 0; i < 16; i++){
	result += characters.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * characters.length))
}
	return result
}
function logLocations(locations) {
	for (const location of locations) {
		console.log(‘Location: ${location.name}, Recommended Character Level: ${location.recommendedLevel}')
}
}
