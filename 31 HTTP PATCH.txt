PUT: Updates entire resources
PATCH: updates partial resources
	How?


a) FOR PUT : we specify id in url to tell which user to update
	then we send entire user object
	can do partial update also though (read documentation)

b) FOR PATCH:
	Update just a name field


Conclusion: PUT > PATCH (popular)
