a) What are status codes in http request?
	How to check if http request went the correct way? status code
	


b) What if error was produced? second layer that we need to pass

first no error condition ---> then status code



c) If something goes wrong -> will produce an error

Client ---------->  Server
	<---------


ex of error scenarios: (something goes wrong in sender --> receiver line)
		domain name in fetch api is wrong -> error in fetch  api
		internet connection down -> error in fetch api
ex of status code scenarios
		request reached server, but processing of request went wrong at server
		no permission to access resource
		backend server is down	
		
d) where is status code? In response http request
	

	when error occur? if something goes wrong
	when status code occur ? everytime
		every response has status code
			



STATUS CODES:

1XX : Infromation response
2XX : See often,success codes
	200 : everything worked
	201 : Resource created (POST usually)
	
	
3XX : redirection messages
	301 : Resource moved to new place, response will tell where the new place is , use case: website change domain name
4XX : Client errors  //authentication 
	400 : Bad request
	403 : Unauthorized : Client does not have correct permission. Ex dont have session token 
	404 : Not Found : Resource does not exist
5XX : Server errors
	500 : Internal server error


//HTTP response body will tell what happened
//log it to console

How ot check status code in actual code? Use .status property on a Response object

Solution:

async function getUserCode(url, apiKey) {
const response = await fetch(url, {
method: 'GET',
mode: 'cors',
headers: {
'X-API—Key': apiKey
}
})
return response.status
}
// Don't touch below this line
const generatedKey = generateKey()


>Output:
id: invalid—id, status code: 404
id: 0194fdc2—fa2f—4cc0-81d3—ff12045b72c "It -, status code: 200




Code(earlier)	
async function getUserCode(url, apiKey) {
const response = await fetch(url, {
method: 'GET',
mode: 'cors',
headers: {
'X-API—Key': apiKey
}
})
}
// Don't touch below this line
const generatedKey = generateKey()


>Output:
id: invalid—id, status code: undefined
id: 0194fdc2—fa2f—4cc0-81d3—ff12045b72c "It -
undefined II'{i\
