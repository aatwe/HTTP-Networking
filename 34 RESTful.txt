a) What is REST? Representational State Transfer

	What is it? standard & convention for building better APIs


b) What is goal of REST api? 
	adhere to certain rules
	Better experience to the client
	

c) What separates RESTful servers from others

	Client: can write in any programming language


	Server: can write in any programming language


	What common?
		name for resources, JSON / encoding scheme etc


	c.1) How is it stateless? Client and server dont keep track of past interactions they've had


	if client requests for 10 users --> Server gives
	if client requests for 10 more --> Server gives same 10 // Server doesnt remember  and give next 10


	CONCLUSION: 	Answers client request
				Doesnt remember state and modifies its answer


	
	RESTful: tells state of resources
		   do not tell arbit commands



d) REST is not mandatory but safer to use
	other conventions exist: for ex GraphQL
	d.1) is last part of url always the resource? YES

e)
